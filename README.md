# Overlook

## Abstract:
Lots of people want to book a stay at a luxurious getaway, Overlook allows users to login to their Overlook Apiary Hotel account, see their total amount spent, past/upcoming bookings, and even book a stay. The application usings network requests to get the customer's stored information, all the hotel bookings, and room information. When a customer books a room, a POST request is sent to the server.

## Context:
Each member of our group has been in Turing for 3 months. (Mod2, week 5)

## Learning Goals:
1. Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
2. Work with an API to send and receive data
3. Solidify the code review process
4. Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Technology Used:

VS Code
JavaScript
Mocha
Chai
Github
Terminal
WebPack
HTML
CSS
WAVE Chrome Extension  
Lighthouse Extension
Dalton Chrome Extension 
Figma Wireframing

## Wins:

1. The classes that I created were incredibly streamlined and effective. I am particularly pround of my login in class, which allowed for more organization of login data and kept the scripts.js more organized.
2. The planning that I did for this project was detailed and organized which allowed me to effectively work and produce a quality product with the time I was alloted.
3. The use of complex iterations kept my data model DRY and my logic easy to follow.

## Challenges:

The largest area for growth during this project was the GET requests and the POST requests. The project was the first opportunity that I got, to create GET/POST requests without a group to collaborate with. While I was not as practiced with the concepts at the beginning of this project, at the end, I felt very confident in my abilities to create GET/POST requests.
